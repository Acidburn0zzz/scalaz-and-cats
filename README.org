* ScalaZ and Cats Comparison

This project aims to give a fair comparison of basic usage and benchmark
timings for the Scala FP libraries ScalaZ and Cats. For contrast, identical
Haskell examples are also provided.

The hope is that this can also serve as an educational tool / reference for
other projects that are committed to Scala and considering adopting one
library or the other.

You are encouraged to open three browser windows and compare the Haskell,
Cats, and ScalaZ examples side-by-side.
